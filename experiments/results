## Best Performing Configuration

•⁠  ⁠Model: ResNet-18 Autoencoder
•⁠  ⁠Seed: 82
•⁠  ⁠Input: Single RGB frame (128×128)
•⁠  ⁠Inference: Test-Time Augmentation (flip + rotation)
•⁠  ⁠Metric: Average Precision (AP)
•⁠  ⁠Best AP achieved: 0.6493


## Key Observations

•⁠  ⁠Pixel-level reconstruction error dominates anomaly ranking.
•⁠  ⁠Feature-only scoring degrades performance on noise-heavy anomalies.
•⁠  ⁠Gamma scaling above 1.3 leads to ranking instability.
•⁠  ⁠Per-video normalization consistently reduces AP.


## Stability Notes

•⁠  ⁠Results are sensitive to scoring balance but stable across multiple runs with fixed seed.
•⁠  ⁠Small parameter changes can cause large AP drops, indicating proximity to the model’s ceiling.

•⁠  ⁠## Limitations and Future Work

•⁠  ⁠The model operates on single frames and cannot capture motion-based anomalies.
•⁠  ⁠Optical flow and temporal modeling were not explored due to time constraints.
•⁠  ⁠The approach struggles with subtle semantic anomalies requiring context.
•⁠  ⁠Future work would include temporal autoencoders or video transformers.
